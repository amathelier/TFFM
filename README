We provide here the documentation of the TFFM-framework developed in Python.
The Transcription Factor Flexible Models (TFFMs) represent TFBSs and are based
on hidden Markov models (HMM). They are flexible and are able to model both
position interdependence within TFBSs and variable length motifs within a
single dedicated framework. Using TFFMs, you can predict TFBSs within
DNA sequences and also compute probability of occupancy of a TF within DNA
sequences.

The framework also implements methods to generate a new graphical
representation of the modeled motifs that convey properties of position
interdependence.

TFFMs have been assessed on ChIP-seq data sets coming from the ENCODE project,
revealing that the new HMM-based framework performs better than both PWMs and
the dinucleotide weight matrix (DWM) extension in discriminating motifs within
ChIP-seq sequences from background sequences. Under the assumption that
ChIP-seq signal values are correlated with the affinity of the TF-DNA binding,
we find that HMM scores correlate with ChIP-seq peak signals. Moreover, using
available TF-DNA affinity measurements for the Max TF, we demonstrate that
TFFMs constructed from ChIP-seq data better correlate with published
experimentally measured DNA-binding affinities than PWMs and DWMs. These
results demonstrate the capacity of TFFMs to accurately model DNA-protein
interactions, while providing a single unified framework suitable for the next
generation of TFBS prediction. All the details have been published in Mathelier
and Wasserman, The next generation of transcription binding site prediction.

TFFMs can be saved and opened from files using the XML format already used by
the GHMM library (http://ghmm.org).
